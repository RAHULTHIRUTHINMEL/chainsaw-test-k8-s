hi this is a sample code to test the chainsaw. we have intially creaetd three yaml resources, deployment.yaml, ingress.yaml and sample_ingress.yaml. Then used the script in th chainsaw-test.yaml to create the sample_ingress.yaml from the ingress.yaml. The script uses the envsubst command to replace the $HOST_URL variable in the ingress.yaml with the value of the CUSTOM_URL variable. The CUSTOM_URL variable is defined in the bindings section of the chainsaw-test.yaml file. The script then applies the sample_ingress.yaml file to create the Ingress resource in the Kubernetes cluster. Finally, it asserts that the Ingress resource has been created successfully by checking that the loadBalancer field in the status section is not null.
